# 🚀 GitHub Student Program Eligibility List  


> [!NOTE]
> **These lists were collected manually!**  GitHub does not allow automated scraping of [GitHub Education](https://education.github.com), so all the information in this repository was gathered through manual research.  

## 📚 About This Repository  
This repository contains a list of educational institutions that are **eligible** for the **GitHub Student Developer Pack**. The dataset includes:  
- 📌 School names  
- 🌐 Verified domains  
- ✅ Eligibility details  

## 🔍 Why This Matters  
Many students struggle to determine if their institution qualifies for GitHub's student benefits. This repository aims to **simplify the process** by providing a manually verified list.  

## 📝 Disclaimer  
- This data is **not official** and is not 100% accurate and reliable.
- Just because your institution's name is not in this list or not in github institution selector when requesting doesn't mean you are completely ineligible, you can still try to apply.
- For the most accurate and up-to-date eligibility status, always refer to [GitHub Education](https://education.github.com/discount_requests).  

## 📥 Contributing  
- If you find any incorrect or missing information, feel free to **open an issue** or **submit a pull request**!  
- Only add new Entries to the [Full Student List]() since there is a workflow to add the institution names to the rest of the files.
